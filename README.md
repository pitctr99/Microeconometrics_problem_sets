# Microeconometrics_problem_sets
These are codes of Stata, created by me and other collegues for the course Microeconometrics (20295) at Bocconi University, Milan.
Please note what follows:
1) Problem set 1 contains codes to replicated randomized experiments 
2) Problem set 2 contains codes to implement instrumental variables 
3) Problem set 3 is focused on Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)
4) Problem set 4 deals with Difference-In-Differences (DID) topics
